Week 4 Homework - RPG Game

The webapp I've created is a 90's Pop Star Themed Role Playing Game deploying jQuery, HTML and CSS. 

The game includes music and theme music for each selected character. It allows the user to win or lose depending on how well he or she plays the game. 
Music may be paused if the user wants to do so. Characters have their own stats of HP and attack, and you can select any one as your hero.
